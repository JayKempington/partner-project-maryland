        halls, while College Park counts a huge variety of appealing off-campus
        options for Terps at any stage of their academic journey. Students also
        appreciate the convenience and tastiness of the healthy food at UMD. Our
        award-winning dining program is recognized for its nutrition,
        sustainability focus and facility design.
